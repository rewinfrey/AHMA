      <p>Audio Recording requires at least as much discipline and commitment as learning to play an instrument well. The number of skills involved and mental acuity needed is incomprehensible to the average person. The best way to learn this art is to sit at the feet of a person who has mastered the art and observe closely. Air House Music Academy offers the chance to have one-on-one instruction with someone who has spent years honing that craft.</p><br />
      <p>Starting with the very basics of listening and environmental observation to the practice of the process of recording using all of the tools at your disposal, the training will open your eyes to the why not just the how of the recording arts.</p><br />
      <p>With the advent of simplified digital recording the general consensus is that anyone can record but you and I know that the results rarely, if ever, turn out the way you imagine it in your head. This individual instruction will reveal why this is so and give you the opportunity to receive feedback and develop skills that you will need to make your recordings unique.</p><br />
      <p>You owe it to yourself to take advantage of this rare opportunity.</p><br />
