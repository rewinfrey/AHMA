    <p>Researchers at the University of Montreal used various brain imaging techniques to investigate brain activity during musical tasks and found that sight-reading musical scores and playing music both activate regions in all four of the cortex's lobes; and that parts of the cerebellum are also activated during those tasks.</p><br />

  <div class="span12 quote2 offset3"><p> Researchers in Leipzig found that brain scans of musicians showed larger planum temporale (a brain region related to some reading skills) than those of non-musicians. They also found that the musicians had a thicker corpus callosum (the bundle of nerve fibers that connects the two halves of the brain) than those of non-musicians, especially for those who had begun their training before the age of seven.</p><br />

  <div class="span12 quote2 offset3"><p>In a study conducted by Dr. Timo Krings, pianists and non-musicians of the same age and sex were required to perform complex sequences of finger movements. Their brains were scanned using a technique called "functional magnetic resource imaging" (fMRI) which detects the activity levels of brain cells. The non-musicians were able to make the movements as correctly as the pianists, but less activity was detected in the pianists' brains. Thus, compared to non-musicians, the brains of pianists are more efficient at making skilled movements. These findings show that musical training can enhance brain function.</p><br />

    <p>The musician is constantly adjusting decisions on tempo, tone, style, rhythm, phrasing, and feeling--training the brain to become incredibly good at organizing and conducting numerous activities at once. Dedicated practice of this orchestration can have a great payoff for lifelong attentional skills, intelligence, and an ability for self-knowledge and expression.</p><br />

    <p>Music making makes the elderly healthier.... There were significant decreases in anxiety, depression, and loneliness following keyboard lessons. These are factors that are critical in coping with stress, stimulating the immune system, and in improved health. Results also show significant increases in human growth hormones following the same group keyboard lessons. (Human growth hormone is implicated in aches and pains.)</p><br />

    <h2>Have You Seen Our Facilities?</h2>
    <h4 class="orange">Commercial Free, Inviting and Inspiring</h4>
    <p>We take great pride in our facilities at Air House Music Academy. We purposefully designed and created three separate studio spaces with private lesson rooms to help maximize a student's engagement with music education. One of the many benefits gained by choosing to study music at Air House is a commercial free environment. We believe students should be able to focus on music education and enjoy the experience without unnecessary pressure and advertising.</p><br />

    <h2>Looking For Expression?</h2>
    <h4 class="orange">Play Jazz With Others</h4>
    <p>Some students understand from the first moment they play their instrument that they want to perform. Other students simply enjoy performing with a group of people. Air House is pleased to offer <a href="/ensembles/jazz">Jazz Ensembles</a> guided by dedicated teachers who are well respected in the local jazz community. Here students are encouraged to learn how to listen to each other, while also gaining confidence and practice with improvisation and self-expression.</p><br />
