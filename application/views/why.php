    <p>In addition to offering a variety of styles and approaches, Air House teachers are dedicated to teaching the fundamentals of music and music theory.  Often times fundamental music education is left out of pop, rock or even classical music lessons.  Instead students simply learn songs without knowledge of what they are doing musically.  Or the opposite occurs in which it is all music theory and note reading in types of music that the student is not interested in.  Air House offers the best of both worlds, ensuring that students are able to learn a type of music that is interesting to them, while at the same time learning the fundamentals necessary to become a true musician, not just someone that can play a few songs on an instrument.<br /><br /></p>

    <p>Air House is also strongly dedicated to helping to inspire creativity.  Many Air House teachers are talented songwriters and composers.  While all Air House lessons aim to encourage creativity, lessons are also offered that specifically focus on songwriting and composition for those students who want to focus on writing their own music.  All Air House teachers are unified in the vision of helping each student to find his or her unique voice of musical expression.<br /><br /></p>

    <h2>Have You Seen Our Facilities?</h2>
     <h4 class="orange">Commercial Free, Inviting and Inspiring</h4>
       <p>We take great pride in our facilities at Air House Music Academy. We purposefully designed and created three separate studio spaces with private lesson rooms to help maximize a student's engagement with music education. One of the many benefits gained by choosing to study music at Air House is a commercial free environment. We believe students should be able to focus on music education and enjoy the experience without unnecessary pressure and advertising.</p><br />
