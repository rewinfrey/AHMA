  <h2>Interested In More Than Lessons?</h2>
  <h4 class="orange">Audio Recording Classes Now Offered</h4>
    <p>Audio Recording may require at least as much discipline and commitment as learning to play an instrument well. The number of skills involved and mental acuity needed is incomprehensible to the average person. The best way to learn this art is to sit at the feet of a person who has mastered the art and observe closely. Air House Music Academy offers the chance to have one-on-one instruction with someone who has spent years honing that craft.</p>

  <h2>Do You Want To Solo?</h2>
  <h4 class="orange">Learn To Improvise</h4>
    <p>Air House lessons cover the technical, theoretical and creative aspects of music, providing a well rounded and balanced approach to music instruction. Students are taught proper technique to allow them to reach their full technical ability on their instrument. They are taught basic music theory so that they have an understanding of what they are doing musically. These things help them to become actual musicians rather than simply someone who can play a few songs on an instrument. Students are also encouraged to cultivate and explore their own musical creativity.
