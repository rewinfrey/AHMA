<div class="row">
  <div class="span9">
    <p>Air House lessons cover the technical, theoretical and creative aspects of music, providing a well rounded and balanced approach to music instruction.  Students are taught proper technique to allow them to reach their full technical ability on their instrument.  They are taught basic music theory so that they have an understanding of what they are doing musically.  These things help them to become actual musicians rather than simply someone who can play a few songs on an instrument. Students are also encouraged to cultivate and explore their own musical creativity.  Combining these three aspects of music education provide the student with a technical command over their instrument, an understanding of the theoretical aspects of music and a confidence in their own creative potential, allowing them to make exactly the type of music that they want to make.<br /><br /></p>

  <h2>Music Makes Us Smarter</h2>
  <h4 class="orange">Students Who Study Music Gain Benefits</h4>
    <p>There are many reasons why learning an instrument is beneficial for anyone, but recent research has shown that students who study music tend to do better with abstract subjects in school, like math and science. These students also demonstrate improved reading comprehension. If you're a parent thinking about signing your child up for lessons, you might find some of the results of studies linking longterm success and music education interesting. For example, college admissions officers favor students who study music when making admissions decisions because "music participation demonstrates time management, creativity, expression, and open-mindedness."</p><br />

  <h2>Have You Seen Our Facilities?</h2>
  <h4 class="orange">Commercial Free, Inviting and Inspiring</h4>
  <p>We take great pride in our facilities at Air House Music Academy. We purposefully designed and created three separate studio spaces with private lesson rooms to help maximize a student's engagement with music education. One of the many benefits gained by choosing to study music at Air House is a commercial free environment. We believe students should be able to focus on music education and enjoy the experience without unnecessary pressure and advertising.</p><br />
