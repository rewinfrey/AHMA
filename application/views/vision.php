    <p>We take great pride in our facilities at Air House Music Academy. We purposefully designed and created three separate studio spaces with private lesson rooms to help maximize a student's engagement with music education. One of the many benefits gained by choosing to study music at Air House is a commercial free environment. We believe students should be able to focus on music education and enjoy the experience without unnecessary pressure and advertising.</p><br />
