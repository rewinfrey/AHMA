      <p>Air House is home to the WJF All-Star Jazz Combos.  These groups are presented by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wichitajazzfestival.com">Wichita Jazz Festival</a> and consist of the top high school and middle school jazz players in the area.  While many students have the opportunity to participate in their school jazz band, these ensembles give students a chance to play in a small group setting and focus on their improvisational skills.</p><br />
      <p>The combos are open to middle and high school jazz students on all instruments that would like to expand their jazz skills, theory and appreciation.  There is no better way to learn jazz than by playing in a small group jazz ensemble. The groups are directed by local jazz experts, <a href="/lessons/billharshbarger">Bill Harshbarger</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.craigowens.us">Craig Owens</a> and Gray Bishop.</p><br />
