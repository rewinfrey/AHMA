  <h2>Music Makes Us Smarter</h2>
  <h4 class="orange">Students Who Study Music Gain Benefits</h4>
    <p>There are many reasons why learning an instrument is beneficial for anyone, but recent research has shown that students who study music tend to do better with abstract subjects in school, like math and science. These students also demonstrate improved reading comprehension. If you're a parent thinking about signing your child up for lessons, you might find some of the results of studies linking longterm success and music education interesting. For example, college admissions officers favor students who study music when making admissions decisions because "music participation demonstrates time management, creativity, expression, and open-mindedness."</p><br />

   <h2>Have You Seen Our Facilities?</h2>
    <h4 class="orange">Commercial Free, Inviting and Inspiring</h4>
    <p>We take great pride in our facilities at Air House Music Academy. We purposefully designed and created three separate studio spaces with private lesson rooms to help maximize a student's engagement with music education. One of the many benefits gained by choosing to study music at Air House is a commercial free environment. We believe students should be able to focus on music education and enjoy the experience without unnecessary pressure and advertising.</p><br />
