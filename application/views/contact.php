  <h2>Are You A Soloist?</h2>
  <h4 class="orange">Learn To Improvise</h4>
    <p>Air House lessons cover the technical, theoretical and creative aspects of music, providing a well rounded and balanced approach to music instruction. Students are taught proper technique to allow them to reach their full technical ability on their instrument. They are taught basic music theory so that they have an understanding of what they are doing musically. These things help them to become actual musicians rather than simply someone who can play a few songs on an instrument. Students are also encouraged to cultivate and explore their own musical creativity.
