  <h2>Interested In More Than Lessons?</h2>
  <h4 class="orange">Audio Recording Classes Now Offered</h4>
    <p>Audio Recording may require at least as much discipline and commitment as learning to play an instrument well. The number of skills involved and mental acuity needed is incomprehensible to the average person. The best way to learn this art is to sit at the feet of a person who has mastered the art and observe closely. Air House Music Academy offers the chance to have one-on-one instruction with someone who has spent years honing that craft.</p>

  <h2>Looking For Expression?</h2>
  <h4 class="orange">Play Jazz With Others</h4>
    <p>Some students understand from the first moment they play their instrument that they want to perform. Other students simply enjoy performing with a group of people. Air House is pleased to offer <a href="/ensembles/jazz">Jazz Ensembles</a> guided by dedicated teachers who are well respected in the local jazz community. Here students are encouraged to learn how to listen to each other, while also gaining confidence and practice with improvisation and self-expression.
